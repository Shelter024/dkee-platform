# PWA Icons

To complete the PWA setup, you need to generate app icons in the following sizes:

- 72x72
- 96x96
- 128x128
- 144x144
- 152x152
- 192x192
- 384x384
- 512x512

You can use tools like:
- https://realfavicongenerator.net/
- https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator

Place the generated icons in this directory (`public/icons/`).

For now, a placeholder SVG has been created at icon-512x512.png (you can convert it to PNG or replace with actual logo).
